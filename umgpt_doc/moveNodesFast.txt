pasted 11/26 version of moveNodesFast and asked:

Why is my while loop only undergoing a single iteration:

Important part of response which I utilized:
Potential loop issue: In your while loop, the line stable_nodes[nc_idx] == false;

 should actually be stable_nodes[nc_idx] = false; if you are trying to set the node as unstable.
