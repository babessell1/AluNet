# AluNet

Weighted Leiden algorithm for modeling Alu-mediated enhancer-promoter interaction networks

## Current Progress

1. Finished the structure of ```Graph```, ```Partition``` ```Community``` and necessary helper functions
2. Finished functions for interfacing with R
3. Currently testing moveNodesFast part of core algorithm and implementing other core algorithm logic
4. Currently working on converting Multi-omics data inputs into useful weights for input
