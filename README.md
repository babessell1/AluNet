# AluNet

Weighted Leiden algorithm for modeling Alu-mediated enhancer-promoter interaction networks

## Current Progress

1. Finished the structure of ```Graph```, ```Partition``` ```Community``` and necessary helper functions
2. Finished functions for interfacing with R
3. Finished matrix weight calculatoin functions
4. Unit tested most testable functions
5. All core algorithm components implemented, but
6. Integration test currently failing
